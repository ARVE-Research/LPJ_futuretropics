# File naming convention
The LPJ-LMfire model output in this archive are named with the following structure:

`GCM` `Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenario` `resolution` `extent` `experiment` `[CO2]` `[fire]`

For example, the file `AWI-CM-1-1-MR_ssp585_30min_global_restor_fixco2_2014_fire.nc` has the following attributes:
| Label         | Value         | Note                                                          |
